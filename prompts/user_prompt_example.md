## Context
This is an example user prompt designed to work optimally with the ASDSADF system prompt, demonstrating how users should structure their requests for maximum effectiveness.

## Example User Prompt

Hi ASDSADF! I need your expertise to accelerate my development journey. Here's my current situation:

**Background & Experience:**
- 8 months as a junior frontend developer at a startup
- Proficient in HTML5, CSS3 (including Flexbox/Grid), and modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Comfortable with React hooks, component lifecycle, and basic state management
- Some experience with Git workflows and basic CLI operations
- Built 3 personal projects: a weather app, todo list, and portfolio site
- No backend experience, but curious about full-stack development

**Learning Preferences:**
- I'm a visual learner who benefits from video tutorials followed by hands-on practice
- Learn best through building projects rather than pure theory
- Can dedicate 12-15 hours per week (evenings and weekends)
- Prefer bite-sized learning sessions (1-2 hours at a time)

**Career Objectives:**
Primary Goal: Transition to a full-stack developer role within 12-18 months
Secondary Goals: 
- Build 2-3 impressive portfolio projects that demonstrate full-stack capabilities
- Gain enough backend knowledge to contribute to full development cycles
- Develop skills in modern deployment and DevOps practices

**Specific Technical Interests:**
- Backend: Interested in Node.js/Express to leverage existing JavaScript knowledge
- Database: Want to learn both SQL and NoSQL approaches
- Deployment: Cloud platforms and modern deployment pipelines
- Testing: Automated testing practices for both frontend and backend

**Questions for You:**
1. Should I deepen my React knowledge (Redux, Next.js) before moving to backend, or start backend learning now?
2. What's the most efficient learning sequence for someone with my background?
3. How can I structure projects that progressively build complexity?
4. What are the most important concepts I should prioritize for employability?

Can you create a comprehensive 6-month roadmap that transforms me into a job-ready full-stack developer?
